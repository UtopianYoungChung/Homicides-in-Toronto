### Group by Occurrence year and count the numbers ###
homicides_count <- homicides_cleaned %>%

### transform long to wide format###
homicides_each_year = dcast(homicides_count, Occurrence_year~Homicide_Type, value.var = "ID")


### Group by Neighborhood and count the number of Homicide type to summarise the total ### 
homicides_summary <- homicides_cleaned %>%
  group_by(Neighbourhood) %>%
  dplyr:: count(Homicide_Type, name = 'count_neigh')%>%

### Filter out the total smaller than/equal to 20 ###
homicides_high <- homicides_summary %>%

### Only take the information we wish to use and get the total values of each division en route to a call  ###

### Compares division and neighbourhood ###

### Filter Homicides_compare >= 20 ###
